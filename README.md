# Merging-IBM-Watson-services
By Python
I couldn't do this task due to pyaudio problems. In fact, I tried with windows operating system and I am having the same problem with Pyaudio.
I am still reading and searching. As for now I read that some functions can be used to reduce and make the response faster between the services by using the “for” loop, using while 1 instead of while true and use some library functions. We can use “timit” method to measure the time of execution that each code takes and inform you so you can think of code to speed it up or slow it down. Also, we can use Multiprocessing module as it will improve the performance for the code of multi packages.Also, maby we can use C++.
